# RestrauntAdvisor

**Project Description**
Imagine you were hired by a start-up company, RestaurantAdvisor, like Trip Advisor, but
more exclusively catered for Restaurants. The goal of the Restaurant Advisor is to be a
central place for customers to write reviews about the restaurants that they have dined in.
The company also would like to facilitate online ordering of food items from Restaurants.
The online ordering initially may be restricted for just pick-up orders to keep things simple.
Remember, for delivery orders the whole logistics of maintaining a delivery service with
third party tie-ups like Uber may be complicated.
You may not be able to implement all of the features as described above. At the minimum,
your system should track restaurants. A customer should then be able to login to the
system, view the different restaurants, and then provide rating for the restaurants.
Each restaurant should have a unique system generated id. We also keep track of a
restaurant name, Address, Phone Number, Email, Hours of operation, Types of cuisine,
Type of dining, Price Range, Food Items and Price of the food item. The restaurant types of
dining that we will track are: Fast Food, Fast Casual, Casual Dining, Family Style, and Fine
Dining.
Example types of cuisines include American, Mexican, Indian, Pizza, Sandwich, Chinese,
and Italian. Some restaurants offer multiple types of cuisines, and all offer at least one
type of cuisine.

**Logistics**
Team size for the projects should be two to three at most. Follow the key dates and
deliverable described below. Submit the interim reports, one per team to Canvas. In your
reports, include the team roster.
Technology
Java FX/Java Swing/Java Web Application or any programming language of the team's
choice.
Swing is built into Java and can be used with a simple import – it's a bit dated, but will work.
Java FX looks a bit nicer, but requires a couple steps to setup. These are outlined in the
useful links section. Consider all your options before committing.
Key Dates and Deliverables

**Market Research and Mockup Design (Nov.17th)**
RestaurantAdvisor would like for you to first survey the field i.e. identify the competitors.
You may want to start researching websites like Grubhub, UberEats, ChowNow, etc. The
best way to get a feel for them is to look for restaurants around Milwaukee. Conduct
market research of relevant products such as mobile apps or web applications that do
similar things as the project. Survey the competition designs, and include the report of
what is available out there and what features you can realistically implement by the end of
this semester. Also, use a professional mock up generator to create sample mock-ups of
your final project (see Useful Links section below). Outline your project directory structure,
lookup best practices to do this and include a rough draft of your codebase's organization
to this report. The information must persist, so consider how your group wants to retain
this information.

**GUI Design with some features (Nov.26th)**
Write basic prototype of the application that displays the GUI. Either hard code the inputs
such as restaurant details, and food items or read them from a file and display on the GUI.
Take screenshots of your GUI and include them in a report and upload your source code
and the report. - See helpful links for advice on how to start

**GUI Design with most features (Dec.5th)**
Write prototype of the application that displays the GUI with most of the functionality
implemented. Highlight the different data structures that you have used. They could be
simple ArrayList, Queue, Stack, HashMap, etc from Java Collection Framework. Take
screenshots of your application and include them in a report and upload your source code
and the report.

**Final Report (Dec.11th 11:59 PM)**
Your final report should include the application description, motivation, competing market
research, and your prototype description. The report should include a user manual
describing how to setup the system and describe the application using screenshots of your
application. Highlight where relevant any technical designs and challenging code
accomplishments. Include your project legacy discussing what you have accomplished
and the skills you have acquired independently from the instructor and classroom
discussion. Also include what you would like to accomplish in future, given more time for
this project.

**Final Video Presentation (Dec.12th 11:59 PM)**
Upload a 3-5 minute YouTube video presenting your final project, and paste the link into
the shared Sheet: FinalProject.xlsx
Your upload may include video, or slides with a voice-over, and/or actual demonstration of
your running project. Emphasis should be placed on what the team accomplished and any
special technical hurdles overcome
